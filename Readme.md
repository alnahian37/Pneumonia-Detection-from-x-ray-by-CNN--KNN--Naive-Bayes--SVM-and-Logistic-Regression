The goal of this project has been to identify pneumonia from chest x-ray images using different machine learning and pattern recognition-based techniques.
For feature based deection, we have used the following techniques:Logistic Regression, KNN, Naive Bayes, SVM.
The selected features are: Color Histogram, Haralic Feature, Hu Moment and HOG Feature

We have also used pre-trained Resnet-18 and finetuned it for our task in Pytorch
